      ##  Description
    
      This repository contains a Python script designed to scan and exploit the OpenSSH CVE-2024-6387 vulnerability. The vulnerability is a remote unauthenticated code execution flaw caused by a signal handler race condition in the OpenSSH server (`sshd`). This tool can be used to identify servers running vulnerable versions of OpenSSH and optionally exploit the vulnerability to gain root access.

      ##  Details
    
      The CVE-2024-6387 vulnerability was discovered in May 2024 and allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as root. The flaw exists due to a race condition in the signal handler of `sshd`, where asynchronous function calls can lead to memory corruption or code execution.
    
      For technical details, refer to the CVE report and related security advisories.
    
      ## ‚öô Usage
    
      ### Prerequisites
    
      - Python 3.x
      - Compiled `exploit.so` (shared library containing the exploit logic)
    
      ### Scanning OpenSSH Servers
    
      To scan a server for the CVE-2024-6387 vulnerability, use the following command:
    
      ```bash
      python3 cve_2024_6387.py 192.168.56.101
      ```
    
      ### Exploiting Vulnerabilities
    
      To exploit identified vulnerable servers:
    
      ```bash
      python3 cve_2024_6387.py 192.168.56.101 --exploit
      ```
    
      ### Exporting Results
    
      You can export the results in different formats (CSV, TXT, JSON):
    
      ```bash
      python3 cve_2024_6387.py 192.168.56.101 -o result.json --format json
      ```
    
      ### Scanning Multiple Targets
    
      To scan multiple IP addresses or a CIDR range:
    
      ```bash
      python3 cve_2024_6387.py -f targets.txt
      ```
    
      ### Adding Timeout
    
      Specify a connection timeout (in seconds):
    
      ```bash
      python3 cve_2024_6387.py 192.168.56.101 -t 10
      ```
    
      ### Custom Port
    
      To scan a non-standard SSH port:
    
      ```bash
      python3 cve_2024_6387.py 192.168.56.101:2244
      ```
    
      ### Network Ranges
    
      Scan an entire network range:
    
      ```bash
      python3 cve_2024_6387.py 192.168.56.0/24
      ```

      ## üîç Host Discovery
    
      This tool allows you to discover vulnerable hosts on a network using various input methods, including single IP addresses, CIDR ranges, or lists of targets in a file.
    
      ## üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation
    
      To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to update OpenSSH to the latest version where the issue has been patched. Additionally, consider reducing the `LoginGraceTime` value to minimize the risk.
